# TOP-150-Problems
# 150 Python Coding Problems - Logical Building Journey

Welcome to my personal coding challenge, where I committed to solving 150 classic and logical Python problems over a span of a few days. The goal was to sharpen my problem-solving skills, strengthen foundational logic, and revisit essential algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🚀 Challenge Highlights

- ✅ Total Problems Solved: **150**
- 🧩 Focus Areas:
  - Basic math and number theory
  - Loops, recursion, and conditionals
  - Arrays, strings, and pattern problems
  - Searching, sorting, and intermediate logic
  - Prime numbers, GCD/LCM, Fibonacci, etc.
- 🧠 Emphasis on logic building without relying heavily on libraries or shortcuts

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Language Used

- 💻 Language: Python 3.12
- 📝 IDE: VS Code
- 🔁 Methods: Recursion, loops, and functional programming (like `map`, `lambda`)

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Clear understanding of problem breakdown and step-by-step logic
- Efficient use of Python syntax and constructs like `map()`, list comprehensions, `lambda`, and `walrus operator`
- Enhanced debugging and dry-run skills
- Mathematical concepts like GCD, LCM, prime numbers, pattern logic, and recursion

---

## 📈 Next Steps

- Move to data structures and algorithms (DSA)
- Start with LeetCode/BinarySearch/Codeforces for competitive prep
- Build mini-projects based on learned logic

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Inspired by self-learning goals and interview prep practice.
